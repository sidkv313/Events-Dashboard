# Event Tracker Dashboard

This comprehensive Event Tracker Dashboard is a Flask-based web application designed to manage and visualize events with criticality-based categorization, providing real-time analytics and an intuitive calendar interface for organizational and project management needs.

## Project Overview

The Event Tracker Dashboard is a sophisticated web application that combines event management capabilities with analytical insights through a clean, user-friendly interface. The application enables users to create, manage, and monitor events while categorizing them by criticality levels, making it particularly valuable for project management, incident tracking, and organizational planning. Built with Flask and SQLAlchemy, the system provides a robust backend architecture that supports real-time data visualization and comprehensive event analytics.

The application addresses the common challenge of managing events across different priority levels while maintaining clear visibility into operational status through color-coded categorization. Users can track events ranging from critical incidents (RED) to milestone achievements (BLUE), creating a comprehensive overview of organizational activities and their relative importance. The dashboard component provides immediate insights into event distribution and performance ratios, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## Features and Capabilities

### Event Management System
The core functionality revolves around comprehensive event management with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations[1]. Users can create events with detailed information including titles, start and end times, descriptions, and most importantly, criticality levels that determine visual representation and analytical categorization. The system supports five distinct criticality levels: RED for very critical events, ORANGE for potentially critical situations, YELLOW for suspicious activities, LIGHT GREEN for good status indicators, and BLUE for great milestones.

### Interactive Calendar Interface
The application features a sophisticated calendar interface built with FullCalendar integration, providing users with an intuitive way to visualize and interact with their events. The calendar displays events with color-coded backgrounds corresponding to their criticality levels, making it easy to identify urgent matters at a glance. Users can click on events to view details, edit information, or delete entries directly from the calendar view.

### Analytics Dashboard
A dedicated analytics dashboard provides comprehensive insights into event distribution and organizational performance. The dashboard displays real-time counts for each criticality level, performance ratios comparing good to bad events, and visual representations of event data. This analytical component enables managers and teams to understand trends, identify patterns, and make informed decisions based on event data.

### Real-time Data Updates
The application architecture supports real-time data updates through AJAX calls and dynamic content loading. When users create, modify, or delete events, the changes are immediately reflected across both the calendar interface and analytics dashboard without requiring page refreshes.

## Technology Stack and Architecture

### Backend Framework
The application is built on Flask, a lightweight and flexible Python web framework that provides excellent scalability and maintainability. Flask's microframework architecture allows for modular development and easy extension of functionality as project requirements evolve. The choice of Flask enables rapid development while maintaining the flexibility to add complex features as needed.

### Database Management
SQLAlchemy serves as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, providing a robust abstraction layer between the Python application and the SQLite database. The database schema includes a comprehensive Event model with fields for id, title, start_datetime, end_datetime, criticality, and description. SQLAlchemy's declarative approach simplifies database operations while maintaining data integrity and supporting complex queries.

### Frontend Technologies
The user interface combines HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive experience. The FullCalendar library provides sophisticated calendar functionality with drag-and-drop capabilities, event editing, and multiple view options. Bootstrap framework ensures responsive design and consistent styling across different devices and screen sizes.

### Data Persistence
The application uses SQLite as the default database solution, providing a lightweight yet powerful data storage system that requires minimal configuration. SQLite's serverless architecture makes deployment simple while supporting concurrent access and ACID transactions. For production environments, the application can be easily configured to use more robust database systems like PostgreSQL or MySQL.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
Before installing the Event Tracker Dashboard, ensure your system meets the following requirements. Python 3.7 or higher must be installed on your system, as the application relies on modern Python features and syntax. A web browser with JavaScript enabled is necessary for full functionality, particularly for the interactive calendar and dashboard features. Basic knowledge of command-line operations will be helpful during the setup process.

### Environment Setup
Begin by creating a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies from your system-wide Python installation. Navigate to your desired project directory and execute the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv event-tracker-env
source event-tracker-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: event-tracker-env\Scripts\activate
```

This creates an isolated Python environment that prevents conflicts with other projects and ensures consistent dependency management.

### Dependency Installation
Install the required packages using the provided requirements.txt file. The core dependencies include Flask for the web framework, Flask-SQLAlchemy for database operations, and SQLAlchemy for ORM functionality:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The specific versions ensure compatibility and stability: Flask 2.3.3, Flask-SQLAlchemy 3.0.5, and SQLAlchemy 2.0.20.

### Database Initialization
The application automatically creates the SQLite database and tables on first run. However, you can manually initialize the database by running the application with the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

This creates the `events.db` file in the instance directory and sets up the necessary table structure.

## Usage Instructions

### Starting the Application
Launch the Event Tracker Dashboard by executing the main application file. From your project directory with the virtual environment activated, run:

```bash
python app.py
```

The Flask development server will start and display the local URL, typically `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Open this URL in your web browser to access the application interface.

### Creating Events
To create a new event, click the "Add/Edit Event" button on the main interface. Fill in the required information including the event title, start and end date/time, and select the appropriate criticality level from the dropdown menu. Add an optional description to provide additional context for the event. Click "Save" to create the event, which will immediately appear on the calendar with the corresponding color coding.

### Managing Events
Existing events can be modified by clicking on them in the calendar view. This opens the edit modal where you can update any aspect of the event including title, timing, criticality level, or description. To delete an event, open the edit modal and click the "Delete" button. All changes are saved immediately and reflected across the interface.

### Viewing Analytics
Access the analytics dashboard by clicking "View Detailed Dashboard" from the main interface. The dashboard provides comprehensive statistics including counts for each criticality level and performance ratios. Use this information to identify trends, monitor organizational health, and make data-driven decisions about resource allocation and priority management.

## API Documentation

### Event Endpoints
The application provides a RESTful API for programmatic access to event data. The `/api/events` endpoint supports GET requests to retrieve all events in JSON format, with each event including id, title, start and end times, criticality level, description, and color information. POST requests to the same endpoint create new events by submitting JSON data with the required fields.

### Individual Event Operations
Specific events can be updated or deleted using the `/api/events/` endpoint. PUT requests update existing events with new data, while DELETE requests remove events from the database. All API responses follow standard HTTP status codes and return appropriate JSON data.

### Dashboard Data
The `/api/dashboard-data` endpoint provides analytics information including counts for each criticality level. This endpoint supports the dashboard interface and can be used by external applications for monitoring and reporting purposes.
